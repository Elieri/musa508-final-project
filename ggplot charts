ggplot charts

- worst delays by train line - bar chart
- network map with delays by stop (graduated symbol)
- line - x axis is stops, y axis is delay - cumulative delay from start to end of line
	- check out geom_step for this
	- highlight 'worst offenders' (top 3?) - different color circle/line?
	- two versions: show actual 'bad delays' then transition/contrast with 
- chart for a given stop - bar chart?

- use hex codes to match app color scheme
